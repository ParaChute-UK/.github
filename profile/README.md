# ParaChute Programme
## About
[ParaChute](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/parachute) is a research programme jointly funded by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/) and the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/), aiming to greatly increase the understanding and representation of convective turbulence in km- and sub-km-scale numerical weather prediction models.  

This GitHub organisation exists to collect code developed as part of, or strongly associated with, the ParaChute programme.  We aim to encourage open source code-sharing and collaboration both within the ParaChute programme, and hopefully beyond to the wider atmospheric convection and turbulence research communities.

## Working practices
### In brief
#### Simple setup instructions
If your code:

 - Is related to the ParaChute programme;
 - Would be useful to others;
 - Can be used by others;
   
then the ParaChute organisation would be happy to host it.  To be eligible for inclusion, the git repository containing your code **must include**:

1. A README providing a brief description of the code.
2. A license; we recommend MIT, BSD, or APACHE-2.0.
3. A list of dependencies.

See our [template repository](https://github.com/ParaChute-UK/parachute-template) for an example.

If your repository meets the above requirements, the recommended method for inclusion is to transfer ownership of the repository to the ParaChute organisation.  To do so you must be a member of the organisation --- contact one of the organisation owners to be invited as a member if you are not already.  Then [follow the instructions here to transfer your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-personal-account).

#### Basic working guidelines
 - If your repository contains general-purpose code likely to be used and developed by multiple people, we recommend a minimum of three repository owners.  This means that even if somebody leaves, two code owners remain.
 - We recommend development is carried out in branches rather than by forking repositories, as this is simpler for the size of repositories we envisage hosting.
 - If your repository has more than one owner, we recommend that all pull requests to the main branch of your repository are reviewed.
